 An ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is an electronic device that allows bank customers to perform various financial transactions without the need for human interaction. It is a self-service machine that operates 24/7 and is commonly found at bank branches, retail locations, airports, and other public spaces.Customers can withdraw cash from their bank accounts using their debit or ATM cards. The amount of cash that can be withdrawn may depend on the customer's account balance and any withdrawal limits set by the bank.
